## ✨ Features

- **Product Management**: Full CRUD with pricing, inventory, descriptions, and per-product image gallery (500 KB max per image)
- **Collection Management**: Organize products into collections with featured products
- **Customer Management**: Track customer information with membership tiers (Gold, Silver, Bronze)
- **Catalog Discovery**: Filtering (collection, price range), search (title, description), ordering (title, price), and page-number pagination
- **Order Management**: Create orders from an existing cart via `cart_id`; payment status lifecycle (Pending/Confirm/Failed) and `order_created` signal hook
- **Shopping Cart**: Hex-based cart IDs, cart item management, and quantity merging
- **Product Reviews**: Nested reviews per product with clean URL structure
- **Product Media**: Nested image upload endpoint under products with size validation and media storage
- **Customer Profile Endpoint**: `customers/me/` for authenticated self-service profile read/update
- **Authentication**: JWT auth via Djoser + Simple JWT (`/auth/jwt/create`, `/auth/jwt/refresh`, `/auth/jwt/verify`)
- **Promotion System**: Apply promotions and discounts to products
- **Address Management**: One-to-one relationship for customer addresses
- **Phone Number Support**: International phone number validation using phonenumber_field
- **Optimized Queries**: Uses `select_related()`/`prefetch_related()` to prevent N+1 query problems
- **Background Tasks**: Celery-ready with Redis broker and sample notification task
- **CORS + Media**: CORS origins configurable via environment; media served from `/media/`
- **Protection Rules**: Prevents deletion of products/collections associated with orders

- email: EmailField (unique, required)
- first_name: CharField (inherited)
- last_name: CharField (inherited)
- password: CharField (inherited, hashed)

```

### ProductImage

Per-product media with validation and optional alt text.

```python

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   cd "C:\Users\coder\Desktop\E-commerce Backend"
   ```

2. **Create and activate virtual environment**

   ```powershell
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```powershell
    pip install django djangorestframework djangorestframework-simplejwt djoser django-filter django-extensions django-debug-toolbar drf-nested-routers phonenumber_field python-dotenv mysqlclient
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install django-cors-headers celery redis Pillow  # extras referenced in settings/code
   ```

4. **Create `.env` file**

   Minimal (SQLite):

   ```env
   SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
   DEBUG=True
   ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1
   DB_ENGINE=django.db.backends.sqlite3

   ```

5. **Run migrations**

   ```powershell
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. **Create superuser**
   ```powershell
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

## ⚙ Configuration

### Environment Variables

Key variables pulled from `.env`:

- `SECRET_KEY`, `DEBUG`, `ALLOWED_HOSTS`
- `DB_ENGINE`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`
- `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (comma-separated origins)
- `EMAIL_BACKEND`, `EMAIL_HOST`, `EMAIL_HOST_USER`, `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD`, `EMAIL_PORT`, `DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL`

### Database Configuration

The project uses SQLite by default. To use PostgreSQL or MySQL, update `settings.py`:

```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'ecommerce_db',
        'USER': 'your_user',
        'PASSWORD': 'your_password',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '5432',
    }
}
```

## 🏃 Running the Project

### Development Server

```powershell
python manage.py runserver
```

Access the application at:

- API: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/store/`
- Admin Panel: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/`
- Debug Toolbar: Automatically appears in DEBUG mode

### Run with specific port

```powershell
python manage.py runserver 8080
```

### Background workers (Celery)

Requires a running Redis broker (`redis://localhost:6379/1` by default).

```powershell
celery -A Ecommerce worker -l info
celery -A Ecommerce beat -l info
```

## 📊 Data Population

### Populate Cart Data

A script is provided to generate sample cart and cart item data:

```powershell
python populate_cart_data.py
```

This script will:

- Create 100 cart records with varied timestamps (last 90 days)
- Generate 300-400 cart items (1-8 items per cart)
- Use random products from your database
- Set realistic quantities (1-5 units per item)

**Note**: Ensure you have product data in your database before running this script.

### Seed sample catalog data

```powershell
python manage.py seed_db
```

Executes `store/management/commands/seed.sql` to load baseline collections/products.

### Manual Data Entry

Use the Django Admin interface at `/admin/` to manually add:

- Products
- Collections
- Customers
- Orders
- And more

## 📖 API Documentation

### Example: Creating a Product

**Request:**

```http
POST /store/products/
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "title": "Wireless Mouse",
    "description": "Ergonomic wireless mouse with USB receiver",
    "price": "29.99",
    "inventory": 150,
    "collection": 1
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Wireless Mouse",
  "description": "Ergonomic wireless mouse with USB receiver",
  "price": "29.99",
  "inventory": 150,
  "collection": 1,
  "price_with_tax": "35.99"
}
```

### Example: Retrieving Products

**Request:**

```http
GET /store/products/
```

**Response:**

```json
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "title": "Wireless Mouse",
        "description": "Ergonomic wireless mouse with USB receiver",
        "price": "29.99",
        "inventory": 150,
        "collection": 1,
        "price_with_tax": "35.99"
    },
    ...
]
```

### Serializer Features

#### Product Serializer

- **Custom Field**: `price_with_tax` - Automatically calculated (20% tax)
- **Validation**: Min value validators for price and inventory
- **Read-only**: `id` and `last_update` fields
- **Query Optimization**: Uses `select_related('collection')` to prevent N+1 queries

#### Collection Serializer

- Simple serialization with `id` and `title`
- Related products accessible via reverse relationship

## 🔒 Business Logic & Validation

### Product Deletion Protection

Products cannot be deleted if they are referenced in any order items:

```python
if OrderItem.objects.filter(product_id=id).count() > 0:
    return Error: "Product cannot be deleted"
```

### Collection Deletion Protection

Collections cannot be deleted if they contain any products:

```python
if Product.objects.filter(collection_id=pk).count() > 0:
    return Error: "Collection cannot be deleted"
```

### Product Image Validation

- Uploads larger than 500 KB are rejected by the validator.
- Files are stored under `media/store/images/`.

### Model Relationships & Cascade Behavior

| Relationship         | on_delete | Behavior                               |
| -------------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Product → Collection | PROTECT   | Cannot delete collection with products |
| OrderItem → Product  | PROTECT   | Cannot delete product in orders        |
| CartItem → Product   | CASCADE   | Cart items deleted with product        |
| Order → Customer     | PROTECT   | Cannot delete customer with orders     |
| Address → Customer   | CASCADE   | Address deleted with customer          |

## 🧪 Testing

### Using Django Shell

```powershell
python manage.py shell_plus
```

Example queries:

```python
# Get all products with their collections
products = Product.objects.select_related('collection').all()

# Get products in a specific collection
Collection.objects.get(id=1).product_set.all()

# Get customer orders
Customer.objects.get(id=1).order_set.all()
```

## 📝 Development Notes

### ViewSet Evolution

The project demonstrates the evolution from function-based views to ViewSets:

1. **Function-based views** with `@api_view` decorators
2. **Class-based views** with `APIView`
3. **Generic views** with `ListCreateAPIView`, `RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView`
4. **ViewSets** with `ModelViewSet` (current implementation)

### Query Optimization

- Uses `select_related()` for forward ForeignKey relationships
- Prevents N+1 query problems
- Debug Toolbar enabled for query analysis

### Serializer Patterns

- `ModelSerializer` for automatic field generation
- Custom methods for calculated fields
- Proper use of `read_only` for auto-generated fields

## 🤝 Contributing
